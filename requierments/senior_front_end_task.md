# **Story:**

Mr. Anthony Russo (Russo brothers) is an independent filmmaker and movie buff who wants to build a simple, beautiful web app where users can search for movies, view details, and save their favorites in a watchlist. He wants a fast and responsive front-end that can run in any modern browser and on mobile devices. The app will fetch movie data from a public API like TMDB or OMDb.


Since he is not technical, he has hired you, a React developer, to build a functional prototype. He will later use this app as a reference to pitch the full idea to investors.

# **Requirements: Tools & Tech Stack**


You should use the following tools:


●​ React
●​ CSS, Tailwind, or any CSS-in-JS solution (your choice)
●​ Git + GitHub for version control and submission

# **Task: Build the Movie Watchlist App**

You will build a small React app with the following core features and pages:

# **0. User Authentication (New Section)**


●​ Allow users to **sign up** and **log in** using email and password.
●​ You may use:
	○​ Firebase Authentication
	○​ Or a mock solution with hardcoded users or fake API (for frontend-only approach).
●​ Once logged in, store session in localStorage or use Firebase's session persistence.
●​ Only authenticated users should access the Watchlist page.
●​ Show a simple navbar link to “Login / Logout”.


# **1. Movie Search Page ( /search )**

●​ A search bar to search for movies by title.
●​ Fetch and display search results from **TMDB API** or **OMDb API** .
●​ Show each movie’s:
	○​ Poster
	○​ Title
	○​ Year
	○​ "Details" button
	○​ “+ Watchlist” button
●​ Handle empty results, loading state, and API errors gracefully.​

# **2. Movie Details Page ( /movie/:id )**


●​ When a user clicks “Details”, show a dedicated page for the movie.
●​ Display:
	○​ Poster
	○​ Title
	○​ Genres
	○​ Plot summary
	○​ Release date
	○​ Ratings​

●​ Include buttons to:
	○​ Add/Remove from Watchlist
	○​ Go back to Search Page​

# **3. Watchlist Page ( /watchlist )**


●​ Show all movies the **logged-in user** has added to their watchlist.
●​ Display at least:
	○​ Poster
	○​ Title
	○​ Year
	○​ “Remove” button
●​ Watchlist should persist **per user** .
	○​ If using Firebase: store in Firestore by user ID.
	○​ If mocking: store in localStorage under a user_id key.

# **4. Navigation**


●​ Top or bottom nav bar with links to:
	○​ Search
	○​ Watchlist (only for logged-in users)
	○​ Login / Logout

**Note:** While functionality is important, **we place a strong emphasis on design,**
**responsiveness, and overall user experience** in our evaluation. Clean layout, thoughtful UI
choices, and smooth interactivity will make a strong impression.


For inspiration on interactivity and visual polish, you may explore [Webflow. Here are a few](https://webflow.com/)
interactive elements worth noting from the example site:


●​ Smooth page transitions and hover effects​
●​ Animated navigation menus​
●​ Scroll-triggered animations​
●​ Microinteractions on buttons and cards​
●​ Responsive layouts adapting seamlessly across devices​


We encourage you to bring in your own creativity and make the app visually engaging.
